                Future Problems for Later Consideration is a collaborative exhibition between sixteen UVic students in
                Lauren Marsdenâ€™s A351 Time Travel course. The media arts course centered around theories of time and techniques
                of time manipulation. As a result, students have produced widely varied works that aim to reflect time as a
                material through digital and installation-based approaches.

                This event is free and open to the public. The work will be displayed for one night only, with the artists
                present from 6:00-9:00pm. We look forward to seeing you there!
